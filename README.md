Horiseon Refactor

This project was assigned to me to optimize the website for Search Engines and to become more accessible to users.

Changes made to code:

    -Removed the <span> within the <H1> to improve Search Engine Optimization(unsure if <span> actually affects Search Engine Results)
    -Added "Alt" Tags to the images
    -Replaced Non-Semantic elements with Semantic elements
    -Re-Ordered the Links and List alphabetically
    -Renamed the website title to Horiseon
    -Fixed the link for the "Search Engine Optimization" since it wouldn't scroll down the page
    -Added comments briefly describing each section and how it correlates to the page
